# Analyzing Customer Churn in a Telecom Company

## Background:

For subscription-based businesses, reducing customer churn is a top priority, In this case study, I'll investigate a dataset from a telecom company called Databel and analyze their churn rates. Analyzing churn doesn’t just mean knowing what the churn rate is: it’s also about figuring out why customers are churning at the rate they are, and how to reduce churn.

## Data Preparation:

first, the data was obtained from https://app.datacamp.com/ which is an excel sheet.

then i started to prepare the data for the analysis process by cleaning it and discovering it on excel pivot table.
